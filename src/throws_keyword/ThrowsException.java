 * itâ€™s not mandatory to use both throw and throws together.
 * You use throw inside a method or block to actually create and throw an exception object.
 * You add throws in a method signature to warn that the method might throw a certain exception, so whoever calls it should handle it.
 * You only need both throw and throws in the same method when:
 * # You are throwing a checked exception, (the compiler forces you to handle or declare with throws.)
 * # You donâ€™t catch it inside the same method.
