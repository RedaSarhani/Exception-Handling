EXCEPTION HANDLING
*******************

An exception disrupts the normal flow of a program but allows errors to be handled gracefully without crashing.

Errors signal critical issues beyond the programmerâ€™s control and are generally not meant to be caught in application code.

Java has two types of exceptions:

    Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.

    Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time.

Custom exception classes can be created by extending:

    Exception for checked exceptions.

    RuntimeException for unchecked exceptions.

Java handles exceptions using try, catch, and finally blocks:

    The try block contains code that might throw an exception.

    The catch block handles the exception if it occurs.

The finally block executes regardless of whether an exception occurred.

Multiple catch blocks allow handling different exceptions separately.

The throws keyword provides better error handling and separation of concerns.

Best practices for the finally block:

    Always execute cleanup code, such as releasing database connections.

    Avoid return statements and unhandled exceptions.
